		- **Projects:**
			- Enterprise SaaS Processes & Platform capabilities for Regulated Industries
				- **Overview:** SSO Integration (OIDC, SAML), RBAC, Custom Roles, Proxy Collector Support. Rewrote all security procedures and controls for SOC II and related audit requirements, Implemented a new customer trust portal for questionnaire automation. Included in the changes supporting this was series of changes to the WAF implementation to block known bad vectors and aligning with standards like OWASP top 10 and Product improvements giving users more control over their authentication configuration. These platform improvements and process improvements aided Moogsoft's push into the high regulated financial sector which supported record quarters back to back in 2022. 
				- **Impact:** For the first time in company history a SOC audit came back with zero material findings after a full rewrite of security procedures, protocols and standards was completed. This drastically increased customer confidence in the product and platform and unblocked several pending deals to move forward totaling ~1.5 MM in recurring revenue. 
				- **Tech Stack:** Â AWS EKS, AWS OpenSearch, AWS Aurora MySQL, Cloudflare DNS, Workers, CDN & WAF, Java, , Vue.js, Kafka, Mongodb, Thanos, Auth0, Ambassador EDGE Stack 
				- **Assets:** 
					
			- **Product Features for Incident Operators**
				- **Overview:** Led a cross functional effort to gather the requirements, design and complete the implementation for several features that when combined created a robust incident management capability within the product. 
					- A situation room aiding operators in managing ongoing incidents with features such as 
					- A chat capability aligned with incidents allowing for general discussion around an incident but also the ability to flag which comments were part of the resolving steps for an incident, allowing for reuse of this knowledge  in future incidents.
					- Automatically detecting similar incidents so that they can be shown along with their resolving steps. 
					- A timeline showing how alerts unfolded over time and allowing for forensics during and after incidents. 
				- **Impact:** These features drove strong sales conversion in Q2 and Q3 where we remained above forecast by 15% across both quarters.

				![[Pasted image 20230828134309.png]]
				
			- **Cloud Cost Savings and Re-Architecture**
				- **Overview:** Led a refactor with my architect to make our services  multitenant aware allowing for a significant reduction in the footprint of the infrastructure required to operate them. We also consolidated several similar services and began to adopt a modules not services approach. This significant reduced the connection overhead on shared components such as Mongodb and Kafka as well allowing for further right sizing.  Finally we negotiated an ELA with AWS, purchased reserved instances and moved to ephemeral compute for services capable of operating in this way reliably. 
				- **Impact:** This led to a 94% cost reduction to operate a single customer. The reuse of infrastructure with multitenant aware services allowed us to deploy far fewer pods and run much more lean clusters. With connections being our primary bottleneck for scaling shared components like Mongo, Kafka and AWS Aurora the reduction in pod count paid dividends and allowed us to shrink these clusters to see further savings. 
				- **Tech Stack:** CloudHealth, Kubecost, AWS Cost Explorer, Excel.... lots of Excel 
				
				
			- Time Series v2
				- **Overview:** Migrated the products timeseries data store from Mongodb to [Thanos] ([Thanos - Highly available Prometheus setup with long term storage capabilities](https://thanos.io/)). Reimagined anomaly detection configuration to enable simple but deep alerting that relied on PromQL. Redesigned query UI to allow for faceted search that genereated PromQL using open source [PromLens] ([PromLens, the query builder for PromQL - PromLens](https://promlens.com/))
				- **Impact:** The new capability allowed customers to fine tune anomaly detection with a dynamic metric policy that leveraged Promql syntax. This lessened the configuration burden for customers to maintain their alerts. This also unblocked the Grafana integration that was on hold. 
				- **Tech Stack:** Thanos, MongoDB, PromLens, Prometheus-Proxy
				- **Visuals:** ![[Z_FEATURE_1.jpg]]
			- **Grafana Infinity Datasource for Moogsoft**
				- **Overview:** Assisted Grafana and a mutual client with developing an [Infinity datasource] (https://sriramajeyam.com/grafana-infinity-datasource/) integration for Moogsoft's existing Rest APIs. This allowed for real time updates in Grafana without any changes in the Moogsoft API or code base. 
				- **Impact:** Several clients were able to reuse the new integration and solve a long standing feature request for the new SaaS product. 
				- **Tech Stack:** Grafana, Infinity data source plugin, Rest APIs

				- **Tech Stack:** Stripe, Salesforce, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Python, JavaScript, Stripe, Sendgrid, vue.js 
			
				
			- Rust Language selection for Collector
				- **Overview:** The initial prototype observability agent for the SaaS product was written in Java and carried a heavy footprint when compared competitively against similar agents in the market. Product wanted to see a lighter weight agent created to make us more competitive. We were also looking for a framework that would expedite integration delivery if possible. This led us to explore, build prototypes and implement an initial version in Rust. Later this was migrated to leverage Vector.dev which is a rust based telemetry pipeline 
				- **Impact:** Aligning with Rust and selecting Vector as the framework allowed us to deliver numerous capabilities for customers and provided them with a reliable platform we were building on. This allowed customers to take on more complex integrations and deployment models to meet their needs for a local installation of our agent.
