## Prototype: Resume Tailor
This is not a product, No navbar or other niceties. Just a tool to test with and refine the key feature for our future product. It's the worlds dumbest form with some chatgpt workflow like logic.  

### To build: 
-one page with a form that takes input from two text area boxes + submit button. 
-Validation if user populated both Job Description and Resume
-Have a third area where results are shown. 
-Job done. 

### Limitations: 
Data is transient / not stored beyond the session 
There is no user management, navbar, or anything additional. It's just the form. 

## Marketing Site Launch: 
### Goal: 
Gather interested parties that would pay for our solution. Although we can allow them in we do not count friends, colleagues, family, etc. We need X (tbd) willing parties before we should move to an Early Access release. 

We want unknowns that are willing to pay for early access to our product. This helps validate our product fit. This gives the early part of our Early Access program some momentum as well when we start to onboard folks. 

### To build: 
Email form 
Setup Contact List in Sendmail or similar
Validate user subscription via Sendmail or similar 

## Minimum Lovable Product for Early Access
The value of our product is very much tied to the accuracy of the tailoring of a resume to a job as well as the time we save customers.  No other tool offers fast tailoring to save job seekers time while also following a best practice to customize your resume. 

For this reason we're looking at ways to cut the time it takes to generate a resume, to tailor a resume and eventually if the market signals us as such through out the hiring process with other capabilities. The initial focus is job seekers and giving them an advantage where they are currently disadvantages against the AI based ATS systems that recruiters use (not teal uses similar marketing around being there for job seekers). 

- A typical but minimal user signup, sign in, sign out and profile management flow. 
- A stripe (or similar payment processor) integration for subscription management and possibly other monetization strategies to follow.
- A browser plugin allowing a customer to easily flag a job they are viewing and kick off a customization of their resume. 
- Integrating the Resume Tailor Prototype as a core feature
-  Resume Templates/marketing content
