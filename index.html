				<p>I'm drawn to the observability space. For me, it's not just about
					understanding and monitoring systems;
					it's about having a genuine, positive impact on the lives of fellow
					engineers. I also believe in building solutions that ensure the seamless
					availability of services and enhance the quality of the customer
					experience. The amount of insight and understanding we can give our
					engineers
					greatly impacts their ability to have sucess. Once I saw this unfold
					originally
					started aligning technical precision with empathy and I intend to carry
					that
					lesson forward through my future roles.</p>
				<p>My vision for the future is clear: mentoring the next generation of
					technical leaders at top-tier tech companies, diving deeper into the
					integration of Machine Learning into all aspects of life, and
					establishing my own micro-SaaS venture. I see these goals not just as
					milestones but as avenues to continuously expand my horizons and
					contribute more profoundly to the world.</p>
				<p>One of my strengths is the ability to bridge the
					technical and business worlds. This skill allows me to anticipate
					business trajectories and align them seamlessly with technical
					innovations. I take pride in my servant leadership approach, actively
					nurturing individual contributors and emerging leaders. By systemizing
					processes and championing transparency, I aim to create an environment
					where decision-making is enhanced and excellence is the standard.</p>
				<p>Grounded in values, I firmly believe in the principle:
					"Do what you say you're going to do, even when it's inconvenient."
					Leadership, for me, is about taking the initiative even in the absence of
					direction. My journey has been enriched by inspirations from the
					open-source community, industry stalwarts like Jason Kalich and Arne
					Josefsberg, Phil Tee and insightful reads such as "Good to Great" and
					"Turn This Ship Around".</p>
				<p>As I continue on this path, I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of
					what's possible in the observability space, always seeking to blend
					innovation with empathy.</p>

												<p>Enterprise SaaS Processes &amp; Platform capabilities for Regulated
													Industries</p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Overview:</strong> SSO Integration (OIDC, SAML), RBAC,
														Custom Roles,
														Proxy Collector Support. Rewrote all security procedures and
														controls for SOC II
														and related audit requirements, Implemented a new customer trust
														portal for
														questionnaire automation. Included in the changes supporting
														this was series of
														changes to the WAF implementation to block known bad vectors and
														aligning with
														standards like OWASP top 10 and Product improvements giving
														users more control
														over their authentication configuration. These platform
														improvements and process
														improvements aided Moogsoft&#39;s push into the high regulated
														financial sector
														which supported record quarters back to back in 2022. </li>
													<li><strong>Impact:</strong> For the first time in company history a
														SOC audit came
														back with zero material findings after a full rewrite of
														security procedures,
														protocols and standards was completed. This drastically
														increased customer
														confidence in the product and platform and unblocked several
														pending deals to
														move forward totaling ~1.5 MM in recurring revenue. </li>
													<li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Â AWS EKS, AWS OpenSearch, AWS
														Aurora MySQL,
														Cloudflare DNS, Workers, CDN &amp; WAF, Java, , Vue.js, Kafka,
														Mongodb, Thanos,
														Auth0, Ambassador EDGE Stack </li>
												</ul>

											<li>
												<p><strong>Product Features for Incident Operators</strong></p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Overview:</strong> Led a cross functional effort to
														gather the
														requirements, design and complete the implementation for several
														features that
														when combined created a robust incident management capability
														within the
														product. <ul>
															<li>A situation room aiding operators in managing ongoing
																incidents with
																features such as </li>
															<li>A chat capability aligned with incidents allowing for
																general discussion
																around an incident but also the ability to flag which
																comments were part
																of the resolving steps for an incident, allowing for
																reuse of this
																knowledge in future incidents.</li>
															<li>Automatically detecting similar incidents so that they
																can be shown
																along with their resolving steps. </li>
															<li>A timeline showing how alerts unfolded over time and
																allowing for
																forensics during and after incidents.</li>
														</ul>
													</li>
													<li><strong>Impact:</strong> These features drove strong sales
														conversion in Q2 and
														Q3 where we remained above forecast by 15% across both quarters.
													</li>

												<p><strong>Cloud Cost Savings and Re-Architecture</strong></p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Overview:</strong> Led a refactor with my architect to
														make our services
														multitenant aware allowing for a significant reduction in the
														footprint of the
														infrastructure required to operate them. We also consolidated
														several similar
														services and began to adopt a modules not services approach.
														This significant
														reduced the connection overhead on shared components such as
														Mongodb and Kafka
														as well allowing for further right sizing. Finally we negotiated
														an ELA with
														AWS, purchased reserved instances and moved to ephemeral compute
														for services
														capable of operating in this way reliably. </li>
													<li><strong>Impact:</strong> This led to a 64% cost reduction to
														operate a single
														customer. The reuse of infrastructure with multitenant aware
														services allowed us
														to deploy far fewer pods and run much more lean clusters. With
														connections being
														our primary bottleneck for scaling shared components like Mongo,
														Kafka and AWS
														Aurora the reduction in pod count paid dividends and allowed us
														to shrink these
														clusters to see further savings. </li>
													<li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> CloudHealth, Kubecost, AWS Cost
														Explorer, Excel....
														lots of Excel</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>Time Series v2</p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Overview:</strong> Migrated the products timeseries data
														store from
														Mongodb to [Thanos] (<a href="https://thanos.io/">Thanos -
															Highly available
															Prometheus setup with long term storage capabilities</a>).
														Reimagined
														anomaly detection configuration to enable simple but deep
														alerting that relied
														on PromQL. Redesigned query UI to allow for faceted search that
														genereated
														PromQL using open source [PromLens] (<a
															href="https://promlens.com/">PromLens,
															the query builder for PromQL - PromLens</a>)</li>
													<li><strong>Impact:</strong> The new capability allowed customers to
														fine tune
														anomaly detection with a dynamic metric policy that leveraged
														Promql syntax.
														This lessened the configuration burden for customers to maintain
														their alerts.
														This also unblocked the Grafana integration that was on hold.

												<p><strong>Grafana Infinity Datasource for Moogsoft</strong></p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Overview:</strong> Assisted Grafana and a mutual client
														with developing
														an [Infinity datasource] (<a
															href="https://sriramajeyam.com/grafana-infinity-datasource/">https://sriramajeyam.com/grafana-infinity-datasource/</a>)
														integration for Moogsoft&#39;s existing Rest APIs. This allowed
														for real time
														updates in Grafana without any changes in the Moogsoft API or
														code base. </li>
													<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Several clients were able to reuse the
														new integration
														and solve a long standing feature request for the new SaaS
														product. </li>
													<li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Grafana, Infinity data source
														plugin, Rest APIs

								<p>VP of Engineering </p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 year</li>
									<li><strong>Brief Description:</strong> Oversaw all aspects of engineering with the
										exception of the
										data science teams. This included both product lines; On premise and SaaS </li>
									<li><strong>Key Achievements:</strong> During this time we were reorganizing
										engineering and other
										parts of the business to focus on the SaaS product. So both the product and team
										were adding
										more SaaS features and skillsets respectively. This transition alone was an
										achievement as we
										successful reorganized the business around the SaaS product and engineering
										started to gain
										momentum in the new model. </li>

												<p>Provisioning Middleware</p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Overview:</strong> An integration between a custom built
														provisioning
														pipeline, Sales Ops tooling and integration with Marketing forms
														to provide an
														end to end automated provisioning pipeline and automatically
														reaped expired
														trials to keep cloud costs efficient. </li>
													<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Saw a significant improvement in the
														trial lifecycle
														being automated to keep costs down. Estimates were ~10% savings
														on our cloud
														spend for the product line. </li>
													<li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Stripe, Salesforce, AWS Lambda,
														DynamoDB, Python,
														JavaScript, Stripe, Sendgrid, vue.js</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>Rust Language selection for Collector</p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Overview:</strong> The initial prototype observability
														agent for the
														SaaS product was written in Java and carried a heavy footprint
														when compared
														competitively against similar agents in the market. Product
														wanted to see a
														lighter weight agent created to make us more competitive. We
														were also looking
														for a framework that would expedite integration delivery if
														possible. This led
														us to explore, build prototypes and implement an initial version
														in Rust. Later
														this was migrated to leverage Vector.dev which is a rust based
														telemetry
														pipeline </li>
													<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Aligning with Rust and selecting Vector
														as the
														framework allowed us to deliver numerous capabilities for
														customers and provided
														them with a reliable platform we were building on. This allowed
														customers to
														take on more complex integrations and deployment models to meet
														their needs for
														a local installation of our agent. </li>

												<p>Quarkus Framework Selection and Implementation </p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Overview:</strong> Standardized Java coding standards
													</li>
													<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Prior to Quarkus being introduced
														engineers often wrote

											<li><strong>Network Telemetry Improvements &amp; Tooling
													Consolidation</strong>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Overview:</strong> In collaboration with the network
														engineering,
														Storage Engineering, and architecture teams GoDaddy underwent a
														strategic
														overall of network tool and telemetry to prepare for SDN and
														modernization of
														our network stack that was underway. My team and I were
														responsible for the
														observability/telemetry portions of this modernization. <ul>
															<li>Sevone - SNMP was collected with SevOne and Topology was
																created based
																on this data collected. This topology was then fed to
																Moogsoft to aid
																correlation of network outages. SevOne replaced Zabbix,
																Nagios and CA
																Spectrum tools that were managed to all accomplish this
																same workload.
															</li>
															<li>Kentik - Collected Sflow and Netflow from network and
																security devices
																distributed across the companies network. </li>
															<li>Elastalert - Design, Built and deployed an Elastic
																Search cluster to
																help analyze the data coming from Syslog for network
																devices. Via
																Elastalert we were able to start creating more
																intelligent alerts for
																our network components. </li>
															<li>Moogsoft - Moogsoft correlated events using a vertex
																entropy method that
																relied on underlying topology data to understand the
																node fragility and
																likelihood that it is potentially the source of impact.
															</li>
															<li>ServiceNow - All device records, metadata and
																provisioning of devices
																into the other monitoring applications was driven from
																ServiceNow using
																a custom development integration.</li>
														</ul>
													</li>
													<li><strong>Impact:</strong>
														<ul>
															<li>All Networking alerts were correlated to reduce overhead
																the network
																team and MTTR was reduced by 40%. </li>
															<li>Near Realtime topology was available for correlation and
																to operators
																within Moogsoft. This aided in proper diagnosis of an
																incident being a
																hazardous condition (loss of redundancy) vs actual
																impact making the
																network operations team more efficient. </li>
															<li>Through the analytics and alerting automated mitigation
																was improved
																from ~15 Minutes to mitigate once a bad actor was
																detected to sub minute
																once detected.</li>
